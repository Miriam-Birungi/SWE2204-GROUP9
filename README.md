##  Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach  

We applied the GQM methodology to align software measurements with project objectives.  

### Example GQM Application for Hotel Performance Ranking:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Goal: Improve hotel service quality by *enhancing customer satisfaction* ratings.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Questions:  
   - How many users give a 5-star rating?  
   - What are the common reasons for low hotel ratings?  
   - Which hotel attributes influence customer satisfaction the most?  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Metrics:  
   - Average Hotel Rating (‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)  
   - Booking Frequency per Hotel ‚Äì (Total Bookings √∑ Month)  
   - Sentiment Score from Customer Reviews

## üèÜ Hotel Ranking Model (1-5 Star System)  

### Problem Definition:  
We rank hotels based on user preferences using an ordinal scale (1-5 stars).  

### Hotels and Their Average Ratings: 

| Hotel Name                  | Average Rating (1-5 Stars)    | Ranking            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------        |
| H1 ‚Äì Speke Resort Munyonyo  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4.8)            | Highly Recommended |
| H2 ‚Äì Acacia Lodge           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4.2)             | Good Choice        |
| H3 ‚Äì Lake View Hotel        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (3.6)              | Average            |
| H4 ‚Äì Agip Hotel             | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2.8)               | Needs Improvement  |

A hotel is considered better than another if its rating is 0.5 stars higher.  

### Formula for Hotel Performance Rating:  
\[
Hotel Rating Score = {sum ({User Rating} *{Weight})}/{Total Reviews}
\]
For example,  
- If H1 (4.8) > H3 (3.6), then H1 is preferred over H3.
