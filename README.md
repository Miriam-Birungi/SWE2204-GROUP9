##  Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach  

We applied the GQM methodology to align software measurements with project objectives.  

### Example GQM Application for Hotel Performance Ranking:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Goal: Improve hotel service quality by *enhancing customer satisfaction* ratings.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Questions:  
   - How many users give a 5-star rating?  
   - What are the common reasons for low hotel ratings?  
   - Which hotel attributes influence customer satisfaction the most?  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Metrics:  
   - Average Hotel Rating (‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê, ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)  
   - Booking Frequency per Hotel ‚Äì (Total Bookings √∑ Month)  
   - Sentiment Score from Customer Reviews

## üèÜ Hotel Ranking Model (1-5 Star System)  

### Problem Definition:  
We rank hotels based on user preferences using an ordinal scale (1-5 stars).  

### Hotels and Their Average Ratings: 

| Hotel Name                  | Average Rating (1-5 Stars)    | Ranking            |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------        |
| H1 ‚Äì Speke Resort Munyonyo  | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4.8)            | Highly Recommended |
| H2 ‚Äì Acacia Lodge           | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4.2)             | Good Choice        |
| H3 ‚Äì Lake View Hotel        | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ (3.6)              | Average            |
| H4 ‚Äì Agip Hotel             | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (2.8)               | Needs Improvement  |

A hotel is considered better than another if its rating is 0.5 stars higher.  

### Formula for Hotel Performance Rating:  
\[
Hotel Rating Score = {sum ({User Rating} *{Weight})}/{Total Reviews}
\]
For example,  
- If H1 (4.8) > H3 (3.6), then H1 is preferred over H3.

## Automating LOC (Lines of Code) Measurement in Python

To dynamically measure the Lines of Code (LOC) in our Hotel Management System, you can use a Python script to scan your PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files and count.

This python script together with its usage can be found in the [LOC](./LOC/) folder.

## üìú **Halstead's Complexity Analysis in the Hotel Management System**  

### **üîπ What is Halstead's Complexity Model?**  
Halstead‚Äôs Complexity Analysis is a **software engineering metric** used to measure **code complexity** by analyzing **operators and operands**.  
It helps our **Hotel Management System** by:  
‚úÖ **Detecting complex code sections** that may need optimization.  
‚úÖ **Measuring the maintainability & readability** of the system.  
‚úÖ **Estimating development effort** based on logical code operations.  

---

## üìè **Halstead‚Äôs Metrics Used in Our Hotel Management System**  
| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Meaning in Our Codebase** |
|------------|------------|---------------------------|
| **n‚ÇÅ** | Unique Operators | Number of distinct operators in the code. |
| **n‚ÇÇ** | Unique Operands | Number of distinct variables/constants. |
| **N‚ÇÅ** | Total Operators | Total occurrences of operators. |
| **N‚ÇÇ** | Total Operands | Total occurrences of operands. |
| **Program Vocabulary (n)** | **n = n‚ÇÅ + n‚ÇÇ** | Unique tokens in the code. |
| **Program Length (N)** | **N = N‚ÇÅ + N‚ÇÇ** | Total elements in the code. |
| **Volume (V)** | **V = N √ó log‚ÇÇ(n)** | Measures the size of the implementation. |
| **Difficulty (D)** | **D = (n‚ÇÅ / 2) √ó (N‚ÇÇ / n‚ÇÇ)** | Complexity of logic in the code. |
| **Effort (E)** | **E = D √ó V** | Total effort required to develop & maintain the code. |

## **‚öôÔ∏è How Halstead's Complexity is Implemented in the Hotel Management System**  

We use **Python** to **automatically analyze all PHP, JavaScript, and Python files** in the project and calculate **Halstead‚Äôs Complexity Metrics**.  
This helps in **evaluating code efficiency, readability, and maintainability**.  

‚úÖ **Scans all source code files in the project**  
‚úÖ **Identifies operators and operands**  
‚úÖ **Computes complexity metrics**  
‚úÖ **Saves results into a CSV file for analysis**  

The Halstead Complexity metrics can be found in the [Halstead](./Halstead/) folder
