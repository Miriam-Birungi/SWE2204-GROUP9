## 🎯 Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) Approach  

We apply the **GQM methodology** to ensure that software measurement is aligned with project goals.  

**Example GQM Application for Booking Success Rate:**  

1️⃣ **Goal:** Improve the booking completion rate by 15% over 3 months.  
2️⃣ **Questions:**  
   - How many users abandon bookings before completion?  
   - What are the most common reasons for failed transactions?  
   - Which pages have the highest exit rates?  
3️⃣ **Metrics:**  
   - **Booking Success Rate:** (Completed bookings ÷ Total attempts) × 100  
   - **Payment Failure Rate:** (Failed transactions ÷ Total transactions) × 100  
   - **Page Load Time:** Avg time taken to load booking pages
