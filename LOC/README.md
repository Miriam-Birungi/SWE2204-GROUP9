# Line of Code (LOC) Counter

## Overview
This folder includes `loc_counter.py`, a Python script designed to analyze and count lines of code (LOC) in a project directory. It provides a breakdown of total lines, blank lines, comment lines, and actual code lines (NCLOC) for various file types.

## Features
- Supports multiple programming languages:  
  - Python (`.py`)  
  - PHP (`.php`)  
  - JavaScript (`.js`)  
  - CSS (`.css`)  
  - HTML (`.html`)  
- Recursively scans all subdirectories.  
- Differentiates between total, blank, comment, and code lines.  
- Handles encoding issues gracefully.  
- Provides a project-wide summary.
